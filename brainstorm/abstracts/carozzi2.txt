Title   : Beam modeling LOFAR LBA

Abstract:

I will  present the software  project called "dreamBeam"  (dBe). The goal  is to
provide a  common framework  for modeling  radio telescope  beams. In  the first
instance, dBe is particularly geared for LOFAR LBA & HBA. One can ingest element
beams from  Computational Electromagnetic (CEM)  simulations such as  FEKO, NEC2
and GRASP. Use cases  are: generating light curves (i.e. power  as a function of
time  while tracking  a source)  for LOFAR  stations, visualizing  instantaneous
spatial pattern (main + sidelobes) of a station beamlet, and calibrating all-sky
AARTFAAC images.
