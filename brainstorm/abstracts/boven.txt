Title   : Observing Meteor Scatter with AARTFAAC

Abstract: 

Meteors  entering our  atmosphere leave  an ionization  trail that  is not  only
visible,  but  reflects  radio  waves  quite well.  The  detection  is  done  by
monitoring radio broadcasts  from transmitters that are normally  well below the
horizon for the  receiver. These transmitters can be broadcast  services such as
e.g. the  (increasingly rare) analog  TV transmitters. The BRAMS  (Belgian RAdio
Meteor Stations)  transmitters are  especially interesting  to monitor  as their
frequency of apx 50MHz falls within the frequency range of AARTFAAC.

Unlike most other applications, the  requirement here is for simultaneously high
frequency and  time resolution. However, as  the band of interest  is only about
100Hz wide, the resources required to transport and process the data of interest
are actually very modest.  Meteor scatter observing with AARTFAAC would create a
system  that is  not only  very  sensitive to  these reflections,  but can  also
resolve them in direction and elevation, and possibly even their distance.
