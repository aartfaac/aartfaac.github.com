Title    :  AARTFAAC in EoR/Cosmic Dawn Studies

Abstract :

High filling-factor and wide field-of-view arrays at 10-250 MHz are particularly
suited for studies of the redshifted 21-cm emission from the EoR and Cosmic Dawn
on degree  angular scales.  However, in  wide fields of  view, on  large angular
scales and at low frequencies  also Galactic foregrounds are particularly strong
and  polarised.

I will discuss why AARTFAAC and other comparable instruments (e.g. Nenufar, LWA,
etc) are of interest in EoR/CD studies, what challenges they face, and how these
challenges might be tackled.
