Title    :  AARTFAAC in EoR/Cosmic Dawn Studies
Abstract :
High filling-factor and wide field-of-view arrays at 10-250 MHz are particularly
suited for studies
of the redshifted 21-cm emission from the EoR and Cosmic Dawn on degree angular
scales. However, in
wide fields of view, on large angular scales and at low frequencies also
Galactic foregrounds are particularly
strong and polarised. I will discuss why AARTFAAC and other comparable
instruments (e.g. Nenufar, LWA, 
etc) are of interest in EoR/CD studies, what challenges they face, and how these
challenges might be tackled.
