Title: Multi wavelength follow-up with AARTFAAC

Abstract:

Two classes of transients have recently attracted top interest for their extreme
physics,  energy, variability,  and  association with  black  holes and  compact
stars: fast  radio bursts  (FRBs) and gravitational  waves (GWs).   Our research
group, mostly from INAF, includes scientists with a wide range of competences in
multiwavelength data management, analysis  and interpretation.  We have approved
programs for  follow-up observations of candidate  FRB and GW events  at several
telescopes worldwide.

In the  talk I will briefly  present our observational strategies,  some results
and how AARTFAAC may  be involved in the search and  follow-up monitoring of the
mentioned  two  classes  of  transient  sources,  and  the  reciprocal  benefits
resulting from this cooperation.
