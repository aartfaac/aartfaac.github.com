Title:
AARTFAAC Software Architecture, Data Products and Roadmap

Abstract:

In this  talk I will  give an  overview of our  current data products  and their
extraction points within the pipelines. And how additional extraction points can
be implemented  into our  existing pipelines.  As such I  will elaborate  on our
calibration,  imaging  pipeline architecture  and  overall  control system  that
activates aartfaac during a LOFAR observation.
