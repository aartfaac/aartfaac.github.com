Title   : Recovering the largest spatial scales with LOFAR

Abstract: 

The  Milky Way  is a  prime target  for LOFAR.  Most, about  80 percent,  of its
diffuse synchrotron  emission at LOFAR  wavelengths is emitted on  scales larger
than 5 lambda. This corresponds to 5x6=30m at 50 MHz and 5x2=10m at 150 MHz. The
smallest  baselines for  the  LOFAR  stations are  about  40m.  This means  that
standard interferometric  observations do  not recover the  bulk of  the diffuse
Milky Way flux. One  way of obtaining information about this  diffuse flux is to
use LOFAR in tied-array mode (i.e. single dish-like). However, this mode is very
difficult to calibrate in the absolute  sense and this would require an extended
observing  campaign.

AARTFAAC may offer an intriguing alternative, as its observes the entire sky (in
LBA)  instantaneously.  Given  that AARTFAAC  has overlapping  UV coverage  with
interferometric LOFAR observations we should, in principle, be able to calibrate
AARTFAAC and thus the diffuse Milky Way flux in the absolute sense. If possible,
these  observations would  be extremely  useful  for a  variety scientif  topics
related our own Galaxy, such as its spectral index at low frequencies, free-free
absorption of HII regions, and if sufficient spectral resolution can be obtained
then Galactic  recombination lines can  be observed and mapped  very efficiently
thereby providing a new view on the cold neutral medium.
