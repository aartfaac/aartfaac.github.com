Abstract :

One of  amazing features of  low frequency radio  telescopes, such as  LOFAR, is
their ability  to image very wide  fields-of-view. Indeed LOFAR LBA  can see the
entire celestial hemisphere.  In the past this has been  done using the standard
cartesian   Fourier  transform   interpretation  of   interferometry.  Basically
cartesian  Fourier  transforms map  2D  visiblities  onto  a flat  (rather  than
spherical  sky). To  build up  larger images  on the  celestial sphere  requires
mosiacing  and  deal  with   3D  (w-component  visibilities)  require  w-project
techniques. Here I will introduce alternative approach to interferometry, namely
spherical interferomety. It provides a natural way of dealing with the celestial
sphere and with fully  3D uvw samples. I will then show examples  of it's use on
LOFAR LBA data, including recent AARTFAAC data.
