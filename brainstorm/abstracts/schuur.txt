Title   : AARTFAAC front end, and potential hardware upgrade possibilities
Abstract:

During this talk I will present an overview of the current AARTFAAC Subband Data
Offload system, which starts with LOFAR  and its ring interface that carries the
subband data we use. I'll also  discuss the (UniBoard) hardware and network that
is used to interface  the LOFAR data to the AARTFAAC  correlator, and go through
some upgrade options.
