Title: The AARTFAAC sky

Abstract:

I will  discuss the  output images  and our current  methods for  filtering poor
quality or malformed images which can arise from calibration errors. I will then
describe the final calibration step  in the AARTFAAC imaging pipeline, computing
the  correct flux  scaling  for  each image.  This  involves bootstrapping  from
currently published low  frequency catalogs, and resulted in the  creation of an
AARTFAAC LBA all sky reference catalog  comprised of the brightest low frequency
sources at 60MHz. I will present this as a preliminary first result. I will then
discuss  the  sensitivity and  limitations  of  AARTFAAC imaging  and  transient
searching as it is currently operating.
