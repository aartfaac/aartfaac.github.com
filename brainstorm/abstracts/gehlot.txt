Title    : Epoch of Reionization on large angular scales with LOFAR and AARTFAAC.
Abstract :
The contamination due to foregrounds (Galactic, Extragalactic and
diffused) and calibration errors pose the biggest challenges in
detection of cosmic 21cm signal in various EoR (Epoch of
Reionization) experiments. AARTFAAC is a compact array with
high filling factor and wide FoV. It is a suitable instrument for
diffused foreground studies on large angular scales. AARTFAAC-
HBA itself is sensitive to EoR on large angular scales (k<0.2
cMpc-1) and can be used to measure the power spectrum of 21cm
signal. We present results of a pilot study using LOFAR-LBA data
and quantify various wide field and calibration effects (gain errors,
polarized foregrounds) which are also expected to be present in
AARTFAAC observations. This work could provide a better
insight in understanding the nature of aforementioned effects and
mitigating them.
