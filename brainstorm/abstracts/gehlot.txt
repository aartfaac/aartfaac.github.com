Title    : Epoch of Reionization on large angular scales with LOFAR and AARTFAAC.

Abstract :

The contamination due to foregrounds  (Galactic, Extragalactic and diffused) and
calibration  errors pose  the biggest  challenges  in detection  of cosmic  21cm
signal in various EoR (Epoch of Reionization) experiments. AARTFAAC is a compact
array with  high filling factor  and wide FoV. It  is a suitable  instrument for
diffused foreground  studies on  large angular scales.  AARTFAAC- HBA  itself is
sensitive to  EoR on  large angular  scales (k<0.2  cMpc-1) and  can be  used to
measure the power spectrum  of 21cm signal.

We present  results of a pilot  study using LOFAR-LBA data  and quantify various
wide field  and calibration effects  (gain errors, polarized  foregrounds) which
are  also expected  to  be present  in AARTFAAC  observations.  This work  could
provide a better  insight in understanding the nature  of aforementioned effects
and mitigating them.
