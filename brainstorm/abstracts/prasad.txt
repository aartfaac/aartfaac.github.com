Title   : The Calibration and Imaging approach in AARTFAAC

Abstract:

We describe the approach developed  to carry out autonomous snapshot calibration
in real  time with AARTFAAC for  generating confusion noise limited  images, and
descibe its  performance under various  conditions. We quantify  the performance
achieved with various imaging parameters.
