Title   :NenuFAR and AARTFAAC
P. Zarka & A. Loh

Abstract:

We will briefly  summarize NenuFARâ€™s concept and development status,  as well as
first thoughts on its possible use  in coordination with AARTFAAC. The detection
domain  of  coherent  radio  counterparts  of gravitational  wave  events  is  a
particularly  interesting  topic,  although   follow-up  observations  of  other
transients will also be relevant and deserve coordination.
