Title   : Ionospheric Scintillation with All-Sky Imaging
Abstract:

Scintillation due to the ionosphere is visible at all times on A-team sources at
LOFAR LBA frequencies.   This is easily visible on Cassiopeia-A  and Cygnus-A in
all-sky imaging, even  when using a single remote station,  and manifests itself
as rapid variability in the source intensity and movement of the source around a
central  position due  to phase  changes introduced  to the  incoming signal  by
refraction through  large-scale density structures  in the ionosphere.

In this  talk, I  will summarise  my work with  scintillation work  with all-sky
imaging  with the  KAIRA station  in northern  Finland and  hence what  would be
required  in terms  of  data  products to  achieve  the  same measurements  with
AARTFAAC.
