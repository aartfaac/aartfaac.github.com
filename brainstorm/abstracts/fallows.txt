Title   : Ionospheric Scintillation with All-Sky Imaging
Abstract: 
Scintillation due to the ionosphere is visible at all times on A-team sources at
LOFAR LBA frequencies.  This is easily visible on Cassiopeia-A and Cygnus-A in
all-sky imaging, even when using a single remote station, and manifests itself
as rapid variability in the source intensity and movement of the source around a
central position due to phase changes introduced to the incoming signal by
refraction through large-scale density structures in the ionosphere.  In this
talk, I will summarise my work with scintillation work with all-sky imaging with
the KAIRA station in northern Finland and hence what would be required in terms
of data products to achieve the same measurements with AARTFAAC.
