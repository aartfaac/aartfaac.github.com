Title   : New applications for AARTFAAC
Abstract: 
For the moment I see two potential applications.
 
1) Thunderstorm detector/monitor system
It would be nice a have an E-field monitor system. This could also be
interesting
for Cosmic Ray KSP. They are trying to model the E-field layers that influence
the polarity of high energetic particles.

2) Better or less time consuming LBA calibration
Could AARTFAAC be used to improve LBA station calibration? We have 12 stations
so maybe this could give better amplitude/phase solutions. The other problem is
that we
have four LBA modes (LBA_INNER, LBA_OUTER, LBA_SPARSE_ODD, LBA_SPARSE_EVEN).
They take 24 hours of data recording and 24 hours processing. During 24 hours
the
stations can only be used for calibration. Is it not possible to use AARTFAAC to
spread the subbands over the 30-80MHz in record in parallel to observations data
for calibration
 
3) Diagnostic antenna information
We repair the LOFAR stations. For the Operations and Maintenance team it would
be good to have data of the good and the bad antennas. Is this information
available?
We could use it for cross-check with our Stationtest results.
