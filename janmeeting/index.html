<h1>AARTFAAC Brainstorm Meeting, 26-27 January, 2017</h1>

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST <br />
------------------------------------------------------- <br />
 <br />

 -------------------------------------------------------- <br />

		  <p>		  Over the past 5 years, we have been building an add-on
		  facility to LOFAR called AARTFAAC. Its purpose is to monitor the full
		  sky over Exloo in low LOFAR low band (~30-80 MHz) at cadences as high
		  as 1 image/second in order to search for bright, short-duration
		  transients. AARTFAAC is now operational in its first version, and
		  based on various informal responses from colleagues we have reason to
		  believe that AARTFAAC in its present form, or with extended
		  capabilities, may be useful to quite a few of our colleagues.</p>

		  <p> In order to present AARTFAAC's current capabilities to a select group
		  of colleagues and solicit ideas on how to make AARTFAAC or AARTFAAC++
		  useful to as many different science cases as possible, we will hold a
		  small workshop (up to 50 participants). The goal is fourfold:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Present to you the current state of AARTFAAC, preliminary results,
		     and the capabilities we have in mind for adding to it.</li>
	  <li> Hear from you what ideas you have for use of the AARTFAAC data, and
			    what you would need, and can bring, in order to make that use
				possible. </li>
	  <li> Hear from you what ideas you might have for extending AARTFAAC's science, or improve its data taking or calibration, and what it would take to achieve that extension or improvement.</li>
	  <li> Create (the beginnings of) a roadmap for future AARTFAAC development and science.<\li>  
	</ul>

 <p>
						 We are in the process of putting together documentation
						 and other
						 materials that describe the current state and
						 capabilities of
						 AARTFAAC.  If you are interested in joining us, please
						 send a brief
						 expression of interest to , in which you indicate
						 what topics you
						 would like to bring to our workshop for discussion. We
						 hope to be able
						 to accommodate as many interested colleagues, of
						 course, but the
						 discussion format of the workshop may require us to
						 perform some
						 selection.
