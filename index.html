<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  Some of the most extreme tests of physical law come from its manifestations
  in the behaviour of black holes and neutron stars, and as such these objects
  should be used as fundamental physics labs. Due to advances in both
  theoretical work and observational techniques, there is now a major
  opportunity to significantly push this agenda forward and get better answers
  to questions like: How are black holes born? How can energy be extracted
  from black holes? What is the origin of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in
  jets and shocks? Is their primary energy stream hadronic or magnetic?
</p>

<p>
  The AARTFAAC (Amsterdam&mdash;ASTRON Radio Transients Facility and Analysis
  Centre) Project will take advantage of the advent of wide-field radio
  astronomy to exploit this opportunity. Extreme objects are very rare and
  usually transient, so not only must one survey large areas of sky, but also
  must one do this often. We will use the LOFAR wide-field radio telescope to
  hunt for these extreme transients and systematically collect enough
  well-documented examples of the behaviour of each type of transient.
  Furthermore, we will expand LOFAR with a true 24/7 all-sky monitor to catch
  and study even the rarest of events.
</p>

<p>
  Next, we will conduct a vigorous multi-wavelength programme of study
  of these objects, to constrain their physics from as many angles as
  possible. This will eventually include results from multi-messenger
  astrophysics, in which we use neutrinos, gravity waves, and other
  non-electromagnetic messengers as extra diagnostics of the physics of
  these sources. We will then develop a theoretical framework for these
  phenomena and constrain the resulting models with the rich data sets
  we obtain.
